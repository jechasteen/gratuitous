## Development

gratuitous is currently in active development, so there are likely many, many bugs and things will be changing rapidly.

if you happen to find any bugs, I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to submit an issue.
try to give as much information as you can.

i will not be considering pull requests until I get the tool to a "stable" release.
