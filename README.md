# gratuitous

gra·tu·i·tous /*ɡrəˈt(y)o͞oədəs*/

1. uncalled for; lacking good reason; unwarranted.

* e.g. a gratuitous insult

2. given or done free of charge.

gratuitous is an IDE for awesome window manager configs and themes.
The name is a play on the adjective names of other awesome libs (awful, beautiful, vicious)

#### Why Qt?

It started out with wanting to try c++.
I wanted to use a library/framework and the Qt documentation is fantastic.

The gratuitous idea started as a prototype written in JavaScript using Electron, [gratuitous-electron](github.com/jechasteen/gratuitous-electron).

My 'ideal' idea of gratuitous would actually be a vim wrapper written using the awesome lua libs.

## Features

* edit lua files with basic syntax highlighting
* search and replace
* tile editor windows
* open a Xephyr preview with optional auto-reload on save
* persistent settings

## Development

This is my first ever project in c++, so there are likely many bugs, anti-patterns, and memory leaks.
If you are a seasoned c++ developer, be nice :)

If you do find any bugs, I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to submit an issue.

Also, feel free to submit a pull request for bugfixes and/or new features.
Have a look at [the todos](TODO.md).
