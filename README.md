## Development

This is my first ever project in c++, so there are likely many bugs, anti-patterns, and memory leaks.
If you are a seasoned c++ developer, be nice :)

If you do find any bugs, I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to submit an issue.

Also, feel free to submit a pull request for bugfixes and/or new features.
Have a look at [the todos](TODO.md).
